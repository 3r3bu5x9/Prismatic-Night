/****************************************
 * Override default window-list styling *
 ****************************************/

Window-list and Gnome-Classic extension can not accept any user-side theming.
So we need to do hacky file moving to override...

1. Verify the proper path of that extension

  In general,
  `/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions/window-list@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com/`
  has these 2 stylesheets:
    `classic.css`
    `stylesheet.css`

2. Backup those 2 files as something like "xxx.css.org" or "xxx.css.bak".

3. Copy Adapta's files into that place:
  * custom files are placed at
    "${prefix}/share/themes/Adapta/gnome-shell/extensions/window-list/classic.css"
    "${prefix}/share/themes/Adapta/gnome-shell/extensions/window-list/stylesheet.css"

  * copy those 2 files into that place.

4. Restart Gnome-Shell:
  * Press "Alt + F2" and then type "r" and hit "Enter" key.

Those methods are needed in every time when window-list extension package was updated.
